As the nation's premier facility for energy-efficient transportation R&D solutions, TDMGâ€™s sustainable transportation and mobility research takes a whole-system, human-centric approach to solve complex energy challenges and slash greenhouse gas emissions. As part of this approach we collect long-term travel behavior data that tells us how, where and why people travel.",
                "why_we_collect": "TDMG can use this information to understand how travel patterns change in response to federal, state and local interventions. These interventions can include programs, incentives and infrastructure changes. Since the data will be collected for a long time, changes can be directly observed instead of inferred from other data sources. The data can also serve as a control of unmodified behavior for programs that target a small sample of the population.",
